About the Program

We’re hiring four full-time Associate Cyber Security Analysts to join our Cyber Security teams in:

Engineering – Gain hands-on experience managing security platforms, monitoring live environments, triaging incidents, and improving threat detection across enterprise systems.

Design & Assurance – Learn how to embed security into software delivery pipelines and cloud platforms, working on DevSecOps practices, automation, and secure design.

Strategy & Governance – Build expertise in cyber risk, compliance, policies, and governance frameworks that guide security at scale across the organisation.

Cyber Security Management Team – Have breadth across all core cyber domains, working directly with the GM Cyber Security and wider leadership team to support key initiatives and build broad, strategic insight into how cyber operates.

 

Role 1: Associate Cyber Security Analyst – Engineering

In this opportunity you will get hands-on with the systems that keep our business secure. Supporting the deployment, management, and fine-tuning of critical security platforms, from intrusion detection and endpoint protection to cloud-native tooling and data loss prevention.

You’ll actively contribute to monitoring and maintaining live environments, help triage incidents, and learn how to optimise security telemetry for threat detection. It’s the perfect fit for someone who loves learning by doing, and who wants to deepen their understanding of how enterprise security really works.


What you’ll bring:

A passion for cyber and an eagerness to get hands-on with tools and systems

Some foundational knowledge in networking, operating systems, or IT troubleshooting

An analytical mindset — someone who spots issues and wants to get to the root cause

Confidence to ask questions, work through challenges, and grow with feedback

Bonus points if you’ve dabbled in home labs, online courses, or self-led projects

You’ll be based in Melbourne or Sydney, embedded in a supportive team with direct 1:1 mentoring from your manager. You’ll have access to tool-specific training, knowledge-sharing sessions, and a growing engineering community that values curiosity and continuous learning.


Role 2: Associate Cyber Security Analyst – Design & Assurance
In this role you you’ll be embedded in a fast-moving, hands-on team shaping how security is designed and delivered into real tech solutions. Think DevSecOps, secure software pipelines, container security, and cloud platforms.

You’ll be learning from some of the best in the business, supported by curated training, live tool demos, and internal workshops — all while building technical depth through hands-on experience. You’ll work on real-world challenges like embedding security into software delivery pipelines, using automation tools to identify and fix vulnerabilities, supporting threat modelling and risk assessments, and learning how to secure modern platforms from code to cloud.


What we’re looking for:

A keen interest in software security, with a naturally curious mindset and a drive to learn fast

Some familiarity with coding, GitHub, or CI/CD concepts

Not afraid to try, fail, ask questions, and try again

A communicator who collaborates well and thinks critically

Being based in either Melbourne or Sydney, you’ll join a collaborative team with strong mentoring from senior professionals across the Design & Assurance domain. You'll get exposure to other areas like Security Architecture and Control Verification, plus access to curated training on platforms like Pluralsight and LinkedIn Learning. Expect live demos, technical workshops, and the chance to hear from industry experts — all designed to help you grow from the ground up.

 

Role 3: Associate Cyber Security Analyst – Strategy & Governance
This role gives you exposure to the frameworks, policies, and risk practices that guide how we run cyber across the business. You’ll work with experienced advisors on everything from compliance and reporting to awareness and governance programs, seeing how decisions are made at scale. You’ll be supported by a highly experienced team, with steady exposure to enterprise-level work and the chance to build a solid foundation in one of the most transferable areas of cyber.

In this role you’ll help develop and maintain policies, assist with risk assessments, contribute to audit and compliance activities, and support enterprise-wide awareness initiatives. You’ll also get hands-on with reporting, dashboards, and governance documentation — building practical knowledge of frameworks.


What we’re looking for:

Clear communicator, confident working with a range of stakeholders

Strong organiser with attention to detail — especially with documentation and data

Interest in how cyber risk, compliance, and governance work in large organisations

Background in business, IT, law, or policy is a plus — but not essential if you’re sharp, curious, and willing to learn

Being based in either Melbourne or Sydney, be part of a close-knit governance team with deep expertise in enterprise risk and compliance. You’ll get structured training and mentoring, the chance to shadow experienced advisors, and real ownership as your confidence grows. This is a great fit for someone who enjoys problem-solving, clear communication, and wants to understand how cybersecurity is managed.


Role 4: Associate Cyber Security Analyst – Management Team

This role gives you broad exposure across all cyber domains by working directly with our GM Cyber Security, James Ng, and the Cyber Security Leadership Team. You’ll support coordination, project management, vendor engagement, and help drive key initiatives across the enterprise as well as engineering, assurance, strategy, and operations.

You’ll be embedded in the leadership function, gaining insight into how cyber operates at a strategic level, while building practical skills in project delivery, communication, and stakeholder management.


What we’re looking for:

Organised, proactive, and willing to take initiative

Confident communicator, comfortable working with stakeholders at all levels

Self-starter, with evidence of independent learning or side projects

Curious about cyber, with a strong interest in leadership, coordination, and gaining broad experience

This role is based in Melbourne, with close collaboration alongside the GM Cyber Security and senior leaders, offering a unique opportunity to develop a broad and wide-ranging skill set across the cyber function.

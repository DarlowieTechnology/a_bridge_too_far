This type of vulnerability\noccurs when data provided by a web client is used immediately by server-side scripts to generate a page of results for\nthe user. If unvalidated user-supplied data is included in the resulting page without full and proper HTML escaping,\nclient-side executable code may be injected into the dynamic page.\nIn the case of a GET request, this means that a URL which appears to be associated with the site (and therefore\ntrustworthy to regular users) could contain malicious code that would be executed by the user\u2019s browser within the\ncontext of the website when the link is visited. In the case of a POST request, a victim user would have to first be\ncoerced to an otherwise unrelated site which then launches attack using a form.\nIn this case it was established that the email_address parameter in the following two URLs were vulnerable.\nEvidence of URLs requests, payloads and responses redacted\nOther vulnerable locations are noted inSupplemental Data - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting on page 28.\nReflected cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are extremely common in web applications but can have a serious impact.\nThey are typically used to launch site impersonation or phishing attacks, in which unsuspecting users are lured to\nmalicious sites via links that appear legitimate. The attacker is then free to present the user with what appears to\nbe genuine content, in an attempt, for example, to capture authentication credentials. Another common method of\nexploitation is to capture the session token of the victim user, allowing their session to be hijacked by the attacker.\nRecommendation:\nReliable avoidance of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities should consist of two stages - input validation and output\nencoding.\nInput validation involves the application rejecting any characters which are invalid for the field in question, preferably\nby whitelisting a limited set of characters (in a telephone number field, for example, the whitelisted characters could\nbe 0-9, parentheses, and hyphens). This strategy can also help in mitigating other flaws which stem from a failure to\nsanitise input, such as SQL or HTTP header injection attacks.\nOutput encoding requires the encoding of all special characters (such as those used in HTML and JavaScript) in\npotentially malicious data. This is generally done directly before display by web applications (or client-side script), and\nmany programming languages have built-in functions or libraries which provide this encoding (also called quoting or\nescaping in this context). Note that the correct encoding of the output depends on the location that the data is to\nbe used within the response. In the case of it being within the main body of the document, HTML entities must be\nencoded. If the input is to be used within a script inside of a string, the quotes used for that string must be escaped.\nIn general, it is important to ensure that it is not possible for the data to include whatever sequence is used to demark the end of that data and the beginning of something else.\nThe application should be reviewed and, if necessary, modified, to handle malicious data properly. The specific in-\nstances identified in this finding should be addressed, and the application code base should also be examined for any\nsimilar issues which may exist.\nVersion 3.0- Page 9 of 32 Client Confidential\nAffects:\nIP Address DNS Name Page Parameter(s)\n10.x.x.x www.nccgroup-client.co.uk vulnerablepage.html\nvulnerablepage2.html\nemail_address\nemail_address\nVersion 3.0- Page 10 of 32 Client Confidential\n",

The lack of restrictions could allow an attacker to upload an otherwise legitimate file\ncontaining malicious code.

Thus it may be possible to determine if a port is not open.\nClosed UDP ports can be useful for fingerprinting remote systems, and increase the accuracy of scan results. Unused\nports allowed through the firewall also provide an attacker with the ability to bind new services to them if a compromise\nhas occurred.

No\ncookie or session is upheld, as the authentication header (the base64 string) is sent with each request to authenticate\nthe application\u2019s request to the server.\nThe authentication token was the same for every request sent to the web service, suggesting that authentication was\non an application level, and users were only authenticated locally.

Additionally, any attacker performing a successful man in the middle attack\ncould sniff the credentials from the HTTP session.

If HTTP Basic authentication is used, it should be used in conjunction with properly configured TLS/SSL. In\naddition to authentication, each user of the application should be identified to the web service using an authorisation\ntoken, which should be checked to ensure the user is authorised to carry out the requested action.

Versions 1.2 and 1.3 of TLS are more resistant to known attacks, and TLSv1.2 supports\nmore modern cipher suites that are widely acknowledged to offer the best cryptography available for securing Internet\nconnections. TLSv1.3 further improves on security by removing unsafe or unused features, eliminating unnecessary\nhandshake steps and forcing the use of newer encryption methods. It should be noted that use of TLS 1.0 and 1.1 is\nnow flagged as insecure (such as by browser warnings) by the major browsers, and in January 2021 the NSA issued\nguidance urging system administrators to only provide support for TLS versions 1.2 or 1.3.15\nTLS 1.0 was the highest protocol version supported, as shown inSupplemental Data - SSLScan Output on page 30.\nRecent versions of all web browsers support 1.2 and 1.3, and therefore supporting these protocols server-side offers\nbetter security for those clients using modern browsers. TLSv1.2 also supports a class of cipher suites that offer\nAuthenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD).

Google\u2019s Chrome\nbrowser states that the security of connections to websites that do not use AEAD ciphers is \u201cobsolete\u201d. Currently, this\nis not presented as an error to the user, merely as information for anyone viewing the page\u2019s security report (in the\nbrowser\u2019s developer console).

The security benefits of TLSv1.3\ninclude the removal of unsafe or unused features, elimination of unnecessary handshake steps and the forced use of\nnewer encryption methods. As well as preventing encryption downgrade attacks, the streamlined approach to session\ninitiation will offer performance gains over previous TLS implementations.\nIt should be noted that major browser vendors have stated that support for TLSv1.0 and 1.1 will be dropped in the\nnear future.\nSupporting TLS 1.0 as a security control is non-compliant with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard\n(DSS).

  "impactdescription": "A successful exploit would result in the compromise of A1 (user camera images), and lead to a loss of user trust in the Secure Camera brand.",
  "description": "During interviews, NCC Group was notified that the Camera Repository and Storage API use the device ID sent in the request to fetch the images that belong to the specified camera. As a result of those interviews, NCC Group believes that no validation is performed to ensure the specified device ID is associated with the logged in users account or session ID. It appears that a malicious authorized external user could modify the device ID sent in their cameras request to the Storage API, and potentially view images from the Camera Repository that they are not authorized to view. Exploitation of this issue would result in severe privacy violations for ExampleCorps users. If it is true that any user could modify their device ID in order to read images from other users cameras, it would result in significant harms to those users (whose cameras have likely recorded many sensitive images) and to ExampleCorps reputation.",
  "recommendation": "NCC Group recommends this attack vector be thoroughly assessed during the upcoming manual penetration testing effort. The Device Association Mapper component should confirm with the Device Ownership Manager component that the device ID sent in the request belongs to the authenticated user whose session ID was presented in the original request."

  "description": "Administrative accounts and internal infrastructure must take extra care to ensure attackers cannot gain access. If the interface allows access using credentials (for example, using a username and password), those credentials should be randomly generated and unguessable. Credentials that are simple, widely known, or not changed from the default values represent a single point of compromise for the application. The application has an administrative interface that is protected with weak or default credentials. An attacker with access to this interface may be able to gain access by guessing or brute-forcing those credentials, resulting in full compromise of the application.",
  "recommendation": "Change the password to a strong, random value. Do not store the password in source code; ensure that only a small number of trusted users have access to the primary admin password. Do not use this account for day-to-day access. Instead, set up individual accounts for each user with tightly-scoped permissions, and only use the high-privileged account in exceptional scenarios. When employees leave the company, all accounts they have access to should rotate credentials."

  "description": "Applications make use of logging functions to ease development, monitor application activity, or audit actions after the fact. Access controls on the log files are often more lax than those on the application itself. For example, if information that is normally stored in an encrypted form is written to a log, an attacker could access it without obtaining the decryption key. Additionally, an organization may permit internal access to log files with less strict controls than to the applications database. When creating log entries, therefore, care should be taken to ensure that no sensitive information is written, since this could provide attackers an easier path to obtaining that data.While reviewing the applications design documentation, NCC Group identified a code snippet that appears to log sensitive information. The code snippet is listed below:logger.log(\"User entered username \" + username + \" and password \" + password);Listing 1:authentication_proof_of_concept.java line 55",

Generally, a staging environment is a non-production environment and should not be considered secure. NCC Groups experience has shown that non-production environments often have more lax security controls, including: Less-strict access control policies for administration, High-privileged accounts accessible to testing staff, Shared accounts and credentials, which prevent traceability and increase the risk of password leakage, Deployment processes allowing for lower-privileged users to deploy code and enable untested, vulnerable code to be deployed.",
  "recommendation": "Non-production environments should not be considered secure and there should be minimal cross-over between a non-production environment and production data and systems. Developers should not have access to sensitive customer information stored in the production environment, including user camera images (A1), user authentication tokens (A2), user credentials (A9), customer PII (A12), or the OAuth signing key (A13). If data is needed in the staging environment databases for testing purposes, NCC Group recommends ExampleCorp develop fake or masked test data for developers to use. This data should contain no customer identifiable information, or reveal any sensitive user data."

It is common for attackers to downgrade the firmware or software to a version that is known to contain exploitable vulnerabilities. In fact, the release of a security patch can trigger attackers to take notice and develop an exploit for older versions.",
  "recommendation": "Implement an effective downgrade prevention mechanism at each stage of the boot process. This could be in the form of a blacklist of bad software versions. The blacklist must be signed to prevent tampering and must itself be protected from downgrades. Many processors contain general-purpose fuses that can be used to implement such protection."

An attacker with access to the users local network could easily intercept and monitor or modify the applications communication. The unencrypted data includes the following types of data, which could be captured or modified by an attacker:  Credentials, including plaintext WiFi passwords and authentication tokens  Personally identifiable information (PII)  Video footage and audio recordings",
  "recommendation": "Where possible, unencrypted protocols should be replaced with encrypted alternatives. HTTP connections should be replaced with HTTPS using TLS 1.2. In a local-network scenario, it is generally more difficult to deploy and manage TLS certificates to enable TLS communication. NCC Group recommends generating and deploying a device-specific TLS certificate to each camera during the manufacturing or registration process. Assuming the serial number of the camera is SN12345, then ExampleCorps backend could request a TLS certificate from a globally-trusted CA for sn12345.examplecorpwificameras.com. Alternatively, a self-signed certificate could be generated at registration time and pinned in the mobile application. However, this would not protect any communications occurring from the web application. In addition to simply configuring HTTPS, the following changes are also needed to enable secure communications: 1. Ensure that unencrypted requests are redirected to HTTPS. 2. Set the Secure attribute on all sensitive cookies. This will prevent the cookies from leaking over unencrypted channels."

  "description": "Authorization controls refer to an applications functionality for verifying user roles and per-missions. Authorization controls ensure safe access to the application, the data within, the ability to change the system, and more. Every functional piece of the application should have a set of authorization controls that encompasses the use cases surrounding it and prevents unauthorized users from accessing the protected functionality.The application has insufficient authorization controls for access to the Storage API. According to interviews with the development team, it was explained that end user and advertising partner authentication uses the same session identifier mechanism, with a specially-modified session token used to differentiate end users from advertising partner sessions. As a result, in certain scenarios, advertising partner employees (Threat Agent 4, or TA4) may be able to compute valid end user session identifiers to gain access to the Storage API as an authorized end user (TA1).Although Advertising Partners were considered out of scope for this engagement, NCC Group documented this finding for further verification due to the potential risks to end user data.",
  "recommendation": "All application functionality should have authorization controls in place and validate those controls prior to performing an action, including both data retrieval and data modification. Specifically, ExampleCorp should implement an authorization mechanism that ties user roles to session identifiers in a way that cannot be modified by end users to bypass role-based authorization checks."

  "description": "The application stores user passwords using unsalted SHA256. This hash can be performed very quickly, thus hashed passwords are vulnerable to brute-force cracking. An attacker with access to the hashed passwords is likely to be able to recover significant numbers of plaintext passwords using a tool such as hashcat. Passwords are hashed without being salted. A salt is a random per-password value which slows down cracking attempts by requiring attackers to perform a new brute-force attack on each password. For example, with a salt, two users with the password 123456 would have different password hashes. Without a salt, an attacker can perform their brute-force attack on all of the applications passwords at once without any additional work, or make use of a rainbow table.",
  "recommendation": "NCC Group recommends using bcrypt, a widely-supported hash that handles salting automatically. This hashing algorithm is designed to resist brute-forcing attempts. The only aspect of bcrypt that requires manual configuration is the cost factor, a value which determines how many iterations to perform1 (thus determining the amount of processing time necessary to hash a single password). NCC Group recommends that most application use a cost factor of 12. On modern processors, this cost factor results in hashing taking approximately half a second for each password.2 To upgrade to a modern password hash, there are a number of possible strategies:  Discard all existing hashes and force users to set new passwords. This strategy may work well for applications with a small number of users who can be reached directly, such as internal company applications.  Upgrade users at their next login by comparing the existing hash, saving the new hash, and finally discarding the existing hash. This strategy is effective for active users, but can have issues with users who do not log in for long periods of time: their old, weak password hash will remain in the database until they log in.  Immediately upgrading all hashes by using the new hashing algorithm on the existing hashed passwords. When users log in, first hash their password with the legacy algorithm, then hash again with the modern algorithm. This strategy is safe in most cases (even for weak algorithms like MD5), but requires the application to maintain the backwards compatibility logic indefinitely. 1See https://security.stackexchange.com/a/3993 for a more in-depth explanation of work factors for password hashing. 2See https://security.stackexchange.com/a/83382 for a benchmark of bcrypt on a recent Intel processor."

  "description": "The Secure Camera system makes use of an insecure random number generator (RNG) for the camera device ID generation. When used in a context that requires the numbers to be truly unpredictable, usage of an insecure random number generator can completely defeat the security of the system.

  "description": "During design documentation review, NCC Group determined the mobile application periodically fetches advertisements from the advertising partner, which is the primary source of revenue for the Secure Camera platform. It appears possible for a malicious user to disable advertisements by blocking client communication to the advertisement partner, or using a modified version of the client application. This would undermine ExampleCorps business model and could ultimately mean the service does not achieve profitability. However, the overall risk of the issue is low because it is very unlikely that the issue would be exploited at scale due to the technical expertise required for users to set up network blocking of the advertising hosts.",

As a result, it is possible for users to set their passwords to simple values such as 1234 or abcd.

Alternatively, in the event of a password database breach, an attacker is more likely to recover a weak password from a brute-force attack.",
  "recommendation": "When creating or changing user passwords, the application should perform checks for password complexity and reuse of previous credentials. Complexity checks may be performed client side in order to provide immediate user feedback, but must be enforced by the backend service, since client-side controls should not be considered an effective security control. NCC Group recommends setting a minimum password length of 12 or more characters. Do not require users to regularly update passwords, as this results in weaker passwords overall (seeNISTs new password rules what you need to know from Sophos). Finally, strongly consider providing users with the option to use multi-factor authentication for all applications."

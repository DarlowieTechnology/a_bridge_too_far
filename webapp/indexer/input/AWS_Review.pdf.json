The IAMFullAccess inline policy was defined as follows: {  \"version\": \"2020-10-17\",  \"statement\": [   {    \"effect\": \"allow\",    \"action\": \"iam:*\",    \"resource\": \"*\"   }  ] } The above policy gave administrative permissions to perform all actions in iam, including managing passwords, access keys, mfa devices and user certificates.

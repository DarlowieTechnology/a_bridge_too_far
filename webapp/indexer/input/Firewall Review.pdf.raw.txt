report for: fortigate firewall review sample report clientname may 18, 2021 version: 3.0 prepared by: test organization  test organization plc - security testing audit and compliance version 3.0- page 1 of 32 1 executive summary this report presents the findings of the fortigate firewall review security assessment conducted on behalf of client company ltd (clientname). the assessment was conducted on 14/05/2021 and was authorised by clientname. the system being assessed was a fortigate firewall used to provide internal network segregation. 1.1 overview the firewall review identified one high risk issue which could allow a user to bypass a requirement to use a second authentication factor. that is, they would not need to supply an extra token in addition to the correct password and so this would increase the risk of unauthorised access. other issues could allow an attacker to disrupt the network and so affect the availability of internal systems. risk was primarily exposed because of the use of outdated software with known vulnerabilities. other, lower risk, issues were the result of deviations from security best practice in the device configuration. the following table breaks down the issues which were identified by component and severity of risk (issues which are reported for information only are not included in the totals): component critical high medium low total phase 1-firewall configuration review 0 1 2 9 12 total 0 1 2 9 12 1.2 assessment summary it was noted that the version of the operating system in use by the firewall was outdated and so was vulnerable to known security issues. a weakness in the authentication mechanism could be exploited so as to allow someone in possession of a valid set of credentials to bypass any requirement to supply a second authentication factor. that is, they would not need to supply an extra token in addition to the correct password even though this was supposedly required. this would increase the risk of unauthorised access. in addition, an attacker could recover information about the firewall platform (such as model and version information) and this information could be recovered without any need to authenticate. it is acknowledged that an attacker would need to be located within the relevant network segment to access a device; nevertheless, as the unpatched issues included an authentication flaw, this finding was assessed to pose a high risk. the continued use of this version may be indicative of a gap in the software patching procedures. the review of the firewall ruleset itself identified rules which were not appropriately restrictive. users might be able to access services for which there was no clear business requirement. rules were present which did not sufficiently restrict either the source or destination addresses or, in a number of cases, which service was permitted. in addition, a rule was present which permitted connections to two hosts over a legacy management protocol that does not use encryption. a suitably placed attacker could therefore be able to capture this management traffic, leading to them gaining administrative access to those devices. beyond this, a number of issues are raised relating to security best practice, the resolution of which would further increase the device's security posture. it is important to recognise that even low risk issues can often be exploited in combination with higher risk issues as part of a wider attack which seeks to compromise an environment or application. more detailed information on each of the issues which were identified is included inthe technical details. version 3.0- page 2 of 32 1.3 strategic recommendations the firewall operating system was found to be outdated. this should be updated to the latest stable and secure version. in addition, the use of outdated software on this important network device may be an indication that the organisation's patching policies and procedures would benefit from review. in general, these procedures should cover all the devices and technology in use across the information estate. however, it is particularly important that network switches, filtering devices and any perimeter devices should be kept up-to-date. the exploitation of known vulnerabilities exposed through the use of outdated software on devices of this type could have a considerable impact. the firewall rules were not appropriately restrictive. as firewalls are designed to be a security barrier, rules should be as restrictive as is consistent with maintaining the functionality required by the business. it is recommended that a review is undertaken to rationalise the ruleset with a view to minimising the access they provide. an unencrypted protocol was in use. support for unencrypted protocols should be withdrawn in favour of robustly encrypted alternatives and the ruleset amended in support of these alternatives. version 3.0- page 3 of 32 2 table of contents 1 executive summary .

identify security issues that could negatively affect clientname's business or reputation if they led to the compromise or abuse of systems. 3.1 scope the security assessment was carried out in the production environment and involved the following section of work: u firewall configuration review the following device was within the scope of this test: u fortifw01 3.2 caveats the scope of work defined two devices; however, as these firewalls were configured to operate within an active-active cluster it was deemed appropriate to review just one device configuration. 3.3 post assessment cleanup any test accounts which were created for the purpose of this assessment should be disabled or removed, as appro- priate, together with any associated content. revert any waf/ids/ips/firewall changes which were made for the purposes of the assessment. version 3.0- page 5 of 32 3.4 risk ratings the table below gives a key to the icons and symbols used throughout this report to provide a clear and concise risk scoring system. it should be stressed that quantifying the overall business risk posed by any of the issues found in any test is outside our remit. this means that some risks may be reported as high from a technical perspective but may, as a result of other controls unknown to us, be considered acceptable. symbol risk rating cvssv2 score explanation critical 9.0 - 10 a vulnerability was discovered that has been rated as critical. this requires resolution as quickly as possible. high 7.0 - 8.9 a vulnerability was discovered that has been rated as high. this requires resolution in the short term. medium 4.0 - 6.9 a vulnerability was discovered that has been rated as medium. this should be resolved as part of the ongoing security maintenance of the system. low 1.0 - 3.9 a vulnerability was discovered that has been rated as low. this should be addressed as part of routine maintenance tasks. info 0 - 0.9 a discovery was made that is reported for information. this should be addressed in order to meet leading practice. good n/a good security practices were being followed or an audit item was found to be present and correct. version 3.0- page 6 of 32 3.5 findings

configuration review sr-104-001 device software vulnerabilities risk rating high status open description: the firewall was running an outdated version of the fortios operating system software. this was identified as version 6.2.3, released in december 2019. at the time of writing, the latest stable and supported version in this branch was 6.2.8, released in april 2021. the installed version of the software contained an authentication flaw which could allow someone in possession of a valid set of user credentials to bypass the requirement for a second factor of authentication. in addition, there was an information disclosure vulnerability which could allow a remote attacker to recover informa- tion about the platform including version and model information. this issue was originally addressed in version 6.2.1 but was re-introduced in version 6.2.3. the software version from the device configuration was checked against the fortios release notes; this showed that it contained the vulnerabilities below: cve reference cvssv2 fixed in version cve-2018-13367 5.0 6.2.4, 6.4.0 cve-2020-12812 9.8 6.2.4, 6.4.0 it is extremely important that software is regularly maintained with patches and upgrades in order to help mitigate the risk of an attacker exploiting a known software vulnerability. in addition to security features and fixes, software updates will often include additional functionality, performance improvements and features. recommendation: the latest system software upgrades, updates or patches should be applied within a short time following their release by the vendor. additionally, it is suggested that the current patching policy should be reviewed to ensure that future updates are applied in a timely manner.1 in addition the length of time this software has remained outdated suggests that this software is outside the software patching process. the reason for this should be identified and addressed. affects: device installed latest fortifw01

scoped access controls risk rating medium status open description: rules were observed that could be considered overly permissive and allow potentially inappropriate traffic flows. a weak configuration could contribute to a malicious user or an attacker gaining unauthorised access to network services. the primary purpose of a firewall is to be a security barrier, preventing unauthorised access to devices and services by filtering the network traffic. the network filtering can be configured to allow or deny access from specific network addresses to specific network addresses and specific services. best practice dictates that access to services should only be configured for those hosts that require it and that this should be restricted on a need-only basis to the required services. the potential risk from this issue is that an attacker could leverage these widely scoped rules to communicate with hosts or network subnets which they should not be able to. in the event of a compromise of any server it is important that the firewall restricts the accessibility an attacker has. full details of rules considered overly permissive are detailed insupplemental data - test / temporary rules on page 29. recommendation: in general, network filtering rules should be as restrictive as possible while still maintaining business functionality. rules should be configured to restrict access to network addresses and services from only those hosts that require it. devices provided for a specific service should allow access only to that service and should not use the 'any' keyword. rules should be modified where feasible, to restrict the traffic to specific hosts and services as required. the following best practice guidelines should be followed: u rules do not allow access from any source u rules do not allow access to any port from a source network address u rules do not allow access to any destination u rules do not allow access to any port on a destination network address u rules do not allow access to any destination service u rules do not allow access to a range of destination services however, it is worth noting that it may not be possible to achieve this in all circumstances, such as with a public web server where business requirements imply that any network address should be permitted to access the service. affects: device fortifw01 version 3.0- page 10 of 32 sr-104-003 rule permits a legacy clear text protocol risk rating medium status open description: a single firewall rule permitted access via the legacy clear text protocol, telnet. information that travels along a telnet connection is not encrypted, as such data including credentials are susceptible to interception. due to the lack of encryption provided by the telnet protocol, an attacker who is able to monitor a telnet session would be able to view all of the authentication credentials and data passed in the session. the attacker could then attempt to gain access to the device using the authentication credentials extracted from the associated rule from the production vdom is presented below: rule action source destination service 139 allow psz_rds_10.107.143.0/26 switch01.uk.acme.com_10.171.186.81 switch02.uk.acme.com_10.171.186.82 telnet figure 1: securezone-live-inf to zone1-live recommendation: where possible, the use of clear text protocols should be avoided. the network services associated with the identified rule should be decommissioned and replaced with cryptographically secure alternatives. once completed, the ruleset should be modified to reflect the changes. affects: device fortifw01 version 3.0- page 11 of 32 sr-104-004 test / temporary rules present risk rating low status open description: a large number of rules were configured with a name that indicated they were either temporary or used for testing purposes. whilst these temporary/test rules present no direct threat to security, they should be reviewed as a matter of 'good housekeeping' to establish whether they are required. any which are required should be made permanent. it is understood that a significant proportion of these rules are present to provide connectivity during the migration, of servers and their associated services from the legacy network. particular attention should be paid to the removal of these rules following completion of this work, as several rules provide access to privileged hosts and services. full details of rules which appeared to be temporary or test related are detailed in thesupplemental data - test / temporary rules on page 29. recommendation: the rules should be reviewed and removed if no longer required. affects: device fortifw01 version 3.0- page 12 of 32 sr-104-005 rules allow any icmp message type risk rating low status open description: rules were configured that allowed any icmp message type between network segments. icmp can be used to identify connected devices, and may be abused to exfiltrate data, where access controls ordinarily would restrict such action. icmp can be useful for network administrators who wish to determine if a network device is reachable or responding, but it can also be abused by an attacker to enumerate potential targets and learn more about them. icmp can also be used to tunnel traffic out of a network using a tool such as icmpsh. using this tool it may be possible for an attacker to exfiltrate data to an external host. rules which permitted all icmp types are detailed below: root vdom rule action source destination service 17

description: the proxy arp feature, used to support arp translation of ip addresses into mac addresses across network segments and vlans, was found to be supported. permitting arp packets to travel beyond the originating systems network segment may undermine network segmentation. proxy arp is a legacy setting designed for hosts that do not have a default gateway configured. there is usually no good reason to have proxy arp enabled in modern networks as it can allow attacks such as arp spoofing. recommendation: proxy arp functionality should be disabled, unless there is a significant business need. this should be done for each interface using the following command: set arpforward disable affects: device fortifw01 version 3.0- page 16 of 32 sr-104-007 icmp redirect messages were enabled risk rating low status open description: interfaces were configured to accept icmp redirects. an attacker in a position to generate arbitrary icmp packets may be able to manipulate the routing table to launch a man-in-the-middle attack. icmp redirect messages could be sent to the router in order to indicate a specific route that the sending host would like the network traffic to take. on a router that accepts icmp redirect message the network traffic will be forwarded using the specified route. furthermore, some routers will cache the new routing information for use with future network packets. recommendation: icmp redirect message sending can be disabled on network interfaces with the following command: set icmp-redirect disable affects: device fortifw01 version 3.0- page 17 of 32 sr-104-008 network time source not authenticated risk rating low status open description: although the firewall was configured to synchronise with a network time source, it did not utilise authentication. if an attacker was able to modify a device's time with an inaccurate time update, then it would be more difficult during an examination to correlate the system logs. ntp (described in rfc 5905) is a complex time synchronisation protocol, with a number of different features and op- tions such as time update authentication. without authentication configured, an attacker could attempt to update the time by sending malicious time updates. an attacker could do this using open source code or by sending customised network packets, spoofing the source address. furthermore, any systems that depend on accurate time, such as some authentication systems, could be disrupted and potentially cause a denial of service. recommendation: all networked devices should be synchronised by updating their clocks from an authenticated network time source, to preserve consistency between logs on different devices. fortigate devices can be configured with the following commands: config system ntp set ntpsync {enable | disable} set source-ip <ipv4_addr> set syncinterval <interval_int> set type {fortiguard | custom} set server-mode {enable | disable} set interface <interface_list> config ntpserver edit <serverid_int> set authentication {enable | disable} set key <password_str> set key-id <int> set ntpv3 {enable | disable} set server {<ipv4_addr> | <hostname_str> | <ipv4_addr>/<hostname_str>} end end affects: device fortifw01 version 3.0- page 18 of 32 sr-104-009 unrestricted administrative interfaces risk rating low status open description: access controls were not configured in order to restrict access to the firewalls management interfaces. as a result, an attacker would not be prevented from attempting to gain access to the device, or from exploiting any software vulnerabilities which were present. without any management host restrictions in place, an attacker or malicious user would be able to connect to the administrative services. if the service requires authentication and the attacker does not have any authentication credentials, they could attempt to gain access using a brute-force attack. furthermore, if a software vulnerability were present in the service then allowing anyone to connect to the service could enable an attacker to exploit the vulnerability. recommendation: access should be restricted to known management hosts. the following commands can be utilised to configure the firewall via the cli: config system admin edit admin set trusthost1 <ipv4_addr> <mask> end end affects: device fortifw01 version 3.0- page 19 of 32 sr-104-010 no pre-logon banner message risk rating low status open description: a login banner warning the user about any unauthorised access or referring to the computer misuse act was not in use. it is recommended that a pre-logon banner is used to inform users of their rights prior to accessing a device. furthermore if legal proceedings were executed against an attacker it would be easier to prove intent on behalf of the attacker, if they were first warned against unauthorised access. recommendation: a disclaimer should be configured, thereby ensuring users are aware of their legal and procedural responsibilities. general guidelines suggest that warning messages include at least the name of the organisation that owns the system, the fact that the system is subject to monitoring and that the use of the system implies consent to such monitoring. the following command will enable the pre-login banner: config system global set pre-login-banner enable end with the banner being configured as follows: config system replacemsg admin "pre_admin-disclaimer-text" <warning> end affects: device fortifw01 version 3.0- page 20 of 32 sr-104-011 local based authentication risk rating low status open description: the firewall was not configured to utilise a remote aaa solution such as radius or tacacs+ for authentication, instead preferring the use of local users. maintaining access and a secure password for a group of administrators across a large number multiple network devices is not practical, administrators tend to compensate by using easy to remember passwords, or password reuse. recommendation: although it is recognised that the device is generally managed via fortimanager, it is consider best practice to utilise an authentication service for local access. configure the device to utilise radius or tacacs+. the following commands can be used to add a tacacs+ server: config system admin tacacs edit <name> set authen-type <auth_prot_type> set authorization {enable | disable} set key <password_string> set port <integer> set secondary-key <password_string> set secondary-server <string> set server <string> set tertiary-key <password_string> set

one another were identified. although not a direct threat to security, these rules could lead to confusion when administering the firewall. the clarity of a ruleset is important as confusion could lead to a configuration where access to services is overly permissive. the following rules were identified: vdom uat rule action source destination service 8 allow uatuk_site1_fdcs01_10.83.193.80

groups which were nearly identical in their composure: ad_client_port_tcp/udp & ad_port_tcp/udp. the rules noted to be utilising these groups were numbers 40, 89, 111, 112, 41, 33, 35, 46, 48, 76. recommendation: where possible, all rules should not duplicate or overlap others. version 3.0- page 23 of 32 affects: device fortifw01 version 3.0- page 24 of 32 sr-104-013 disabled rules present risk rating informational status open description: a number of inactive rules were identified. although not a direct threat to security, disabled rules can make network administration more difficult. the ability to disable rules is useful for administrators who simply want to disable access to a service temporarily, for diagnostic purposes or to disable a rule which is planned to be re-activated again in the immediate future. despite this, disabled rules should not remain indefinitely and can make the policy configuration unclear to network administrators. this could lead to rules being configured that duplicate disabled rules and could potentially lead to mistakes with the policy configuration. rules which were identified as being inactive are detailed below: root vdom rule action source

that are no longer required as a matter of 'good housekeeping'. affects: device fortifw01 version 3.0- page 26 of 32 sr-104-014 rules without comment text or annotation risk rating informational status open description: the majority of rules did not have a comment or annotation associated with them. although not a threat to security, without comment text, the purpose of rules can be unclear making the administration of policies more difficult. this can lead to a situation where rules that are no longer required remain configured, giving an attacker additional access. it is common for rules to initially be configured to allow access to a limited number of services and hosts and gradually grow over time as the business evolves and access to additional services or hosts are required. when access to a service is no longer required that related rule should be modified or removed. without adequate tracking or change control, it may not be clear as to which rule applies to which service so the rule is not modified. in order to aid the clarity of rules, comment text can be included. this comment text is helpful in indicating why the rule exists. recommendation: all rules should include a comment indicating its purpose. affects: device fortifw01 version 3.0- page 27 of 32 5 supplemental data - widely scoped acls root vdom zone1-mgmt to securezone-mgmt-tools rule action

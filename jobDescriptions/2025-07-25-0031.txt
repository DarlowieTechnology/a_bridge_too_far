Senior Cloud Security Consultant – Melbourne (Hybrid)

Cybersecurity | Cloud | GRC | Consulting



Join a fast-growing, deeply technical cybersecurity consultancy that’s helping some of Australia’s top enterprise and mid-market organisations build secure cloud environments and uplift their security maturity.


We’re hiring a Senior Cloud Security Consultant to join a high-performing team delivering cutting-edge security assessments, cloud transformation projects, and presales advisory across a range of leading-edge technologies and frameworks.


This is a hybrid Melbourne-based role with a strong focus on cloud engineering, security consulting, and GRC (especially Essential Eight and NIST CSF). You’ll split your time between delivery and presales activities – from running capability assessments and leading workshops, to implementing cloud security tools and working alongside customers to strengthen their environment.


What You’ll Be Doing:
Lead and deliver security maturity assessments and remediation planning engagements (e.g., E8, NIST CSF).
Advise clients on cloud security architecture, identity governance, endpoint protection and risk management best practices.
Deploy and operationalise cloud security and posture management solutions in enterprise cloud environments.
Contribute to presales engagements, customer workshops, and proof-of-value sessions with a focus on value-driven consulting.
Work closely with a collaborative and experienced team across technical consulting, architecture, and SOC capabilities.


What We’re Looking For:
Strong experience in security consulting – particularly around security frameworks, GRC, and maturity uplift programs.
Proven background in cloud engineering or architecture, ideally across Microsoft Azure, with exposure to conditional access, endpoint controls (e.g., WDAC, Intune), Entra ID, and E8-aligned controls.
Familiarity with deploying or supporting cloud security tooling in production environments.
Excellent client-facing communication skills, with the ability to present complex security concepts clearly to both technical and business stakeholders.
Experience in a consulting or presales capacity is essential – this role involves both delivery and commercial influence.


Bonus Points For:
Exposure to compliance automation tools or CSPM platforms.
Experience delivering vCISO-style engagements.
Familiarity with MDR or SOC service models.
Awareness of DevSecOps, IaC, or CI/CD environments.

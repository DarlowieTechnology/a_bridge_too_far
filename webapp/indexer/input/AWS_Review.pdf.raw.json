  "sr-109-001 iam roles assigned with excessive permissions risk rating high status open description: an analysis of the configured roles that were then assigned to running ec2 instances indicated that some of them would receive excessive permissions that could allow arbitrary commands to be launched across all the instances, read arbitrary s3 objects, etc. as an example, the following role was present in the aws configuration reviewed during this assessment: [role name] the following is a screenshot for this role listing the inline policies: figure 1: sample role with inline policies attached the \\\"iamfullaccess\\\" inline policy was defined as follows: { \\\"version\\\": \\\"2020-10-17\\\", \\\"statement\\\": [ { \\\"effect\\\": \\\"allow\\\", \\\"action\\\": \\\"iam:*\\\", \\\"resource\\\": \\\"*\\\" } ] } the above policy gave administrative permissions to perform all actions in iam, including managing passwords, access keys, mfa devices and user certificates. this issue was rated as high risk in consideration of the security impact of unrestricted access to the iam service. recommendation: create managed security policies following the least privileges security principle (i.e. including only the minimal set of api commands necessary for operations and listing the resources that would be affected by these commands) and attach these to the roles in use. affects: aws account 123456789012",
  "sr-109-002 overly permissive network configuration risk rating high status open description: examination of the high level architecture diagram and configured firewall rules indicated that the network configuration was excessively permissive and a number of resources were publicly available. after review of the above, the following observations can be made: a large number of resources were publicly accessible. this presents an opportunity for abuse, especially in the case of sensitive or corporate resources. a permissive network configuration was observed, which allowed connections between resources in different sublets and vpcs. this poses a significant risk in the event that a host is compromised, as it would potentially enable attackers to move laterally within the aws account. the aws account held all of clientname's assets, including corporate and production environments. this is considered contrary to security best practice. recommendation: unless necessary for normal business operation, ensure that the network is only accessible from internal addresses, or if not possible, consider creating a whitelist of external addresses which can access the network. clientname should also limit the access privileges and general interconnectivity of the sublets, vpcs, and aws account in line with the principle of least privilege. affects: aws account 123456789012",
  "sr-109-003 unauthorised access to s3 buckets risk rating medium status open description: an s3 bucket was found to be configured with excessive permissions that could allow unauthorised access to the stored objects. this bucket included access to logs of the portal web application. the \\\"any authenticated aws user\\\" is a special group that will include any user having access to aws and not only the users associated with the clientname account. according to the permissions visible above, objects could have been downloaded and also deleted or otherwise edited. additionally, new objects could be uploaded. recommendation: edit the permissions associated to the affected s3 buckets ensuring that no permissions are granted to the anonymous or \\\"any authenticated aws user\\\" group. affects: aws account 123456789012",
  "sr-109-004 user without mfa enabled risk rating medium status open description: multiple accounts were identified which had password authentication enabled but did not have multi-factor authentication (mfa) enabled, contrary to security best practice. if mfa is not enabled, attackers could be able to access the aws web console with just a username and password combination. recommendation: implement mfa for the users with password authentication enabled. affects: aws account 123456789012",
  "sr-109-005 iam password policy risk rating medium status open description: no password policy was enabled in the iam settings. this could result in the creation of weak user passwords. recommendation: ensure a strong password policy is in place. specifically ensure that the following password policy is enforced: passwords should use mixed case; passwords should include at least one number; passwords should include at least one symbol; passwords have a minimum length of 14 characters; passwords cannot be reused. affects: aws account 123456789012",
  "sr-109-006 automated backups not enabled for rds instances risk rating low status open description: automated backups had not been enabled for a number of relational database service (rds) instances. this feature facilitates the creation of periodic rds instance snapshots, which in turn ensure that data restoration is possible in the event of an incident affecting the source database. recommendation: ensure that all rds database instances that host sensitive data have automated backups enabled for point-in-time recovery. affects: aws account 123456789012",
  "sr-109-007 single availability zone rds instance risk rating low status open description: a number of relational database service (rds) instances were configured without the multi-availability zone (multi-az) enabled. without this, should an availability zone specific database failure occur, then amazon rds cannot automatically fail over to the standby availability zone so that database operations can resume quickly without administrative intervention. recommendation: consideration should be given to modifying the configuration of the database instances to enable multi-az. this is especially important if the applications using the databases require high availability. affects: aws account 123456789012",
  "sr-109-008 unused security groups risk rating low status open description: a number of security groups were defined which were unused and may not be required. this being the case, their existence in the configuration increases the risk that they may be inappropriately assigned. recommendation: the unused security groups should be reviewed and removed if no longer required. affects: aws account 123456789012",
  "sr-109-009 subnets using default network acls risk rating low status open description: a number of subnets were identified to be using the default network access control list (nacl), allowing all incoming and outgoing network traffic. in this configuration, the affected nacls do not provide the secondary layer of security defence that they are supposed to. recommendation: network acls should be considered as the secondary layer of security defence against unwanted traffic. consequently, consideration should be given to implementing nacls that only allow the necessary inbound and outbound traffic to the associated vpc subnets. affects: aws account 123456789012",
  "sr-109-010 cloudformation stack without termination protection risk rating low status open description: the termination protection setting available for the cloudformation service was not found to be enabled for one stack. when this feature is enabled for a stack, deletion attempts will fail and the stack (including its current status), will remain unchanged. security best practice for cloudformation management recommends enabling this feature for production environments. recommendation: ensure that amazon cloudformation stacks have termination protection enabled in order to protect them from being accidentally deleted. affects: aws account 123456789012"

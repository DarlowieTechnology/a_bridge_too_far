  "sr-101-001": "sr-101-001 sql injection risk rating critical status open description: a critical sql injection vulnerability was found on one php page, allowing full access to the site's back-end database and extraction of sensitive customer details. this vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is used in the dynamic construction of a sql query, without sufficient input validation being performed. this is usually a very serious vulnerability, as it effectively allows a remote attacker to execute (often arbitrary) sql commands on the underlying database server with the privileges of the web application's database access, leaving the database open to execution of stored procedures, privilege escalation, and information retrieval. it is important to note that this issue could be exploited by unauthenticated attackers. sql injection vulnerabilities of this nature are frequently the cause of high-profile website breaches, so it is strongly recommended that this issue is investigated further. the vulnerability was identified in at least one of the php pages (/scabc/vulnerable_page.php, job parameter). the results of an arbitrary query could be seen in the page by using the union operator to inject an additional select query into the job parameter of the url. in the screenshot below, the query injected is select user(): http://www.nccgroup-client.co.uk/scabc/vulnerable_page.php?job=171%20union%20select%201,2,3,user%28%29, 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16%20order%20by%201%20asc--&postcode=m1%207ef&r=1145767722 data could be extracted efficiently using the mysql limit and offset query options, obtaining one result row per http request. for example, a query such as that shown below could be used to obtain the name of the first table in the contact database (schema): http://www.nccgroup-client.co.uk/scabc/jo3.php?job=171 union select 1,2,3,table_name,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 from information_schema.tables where table_schema = 0x6f6e65636f6e74616374 order by 1 asc limit 1 offset 1-- &postcode=m1 7ef&r=1145767722 the offset parameter would then be incremented to get the next row. the current database was identified as contact, with contact_agent and contact_test also being present. list of tables for the current database was extracted as follows: figure 1: extracted information all customer data (such as addresses and security questions and answers) could be eventually be extracted from the database using this technique. recommendation: the breach was possible due to vulnerabilities in the php source code which queried the back-end database. while only a single parameter in one php page was identified as vulnerable, it is possible that further such vulnerabilities exist which were not discovered within the time constraints of the current black box test. the source code of all pages should be reviewed for code patterns similar to those found in the vulnerable page, and all pages should be recoded to use prepared statements for database access.1, 2, 3 the same principle of using strict input validation and prepared statements applies equally to new development in other web frameworks such as asp or asp.net. banning particular sql keywords in input as a fix for sql injection is discouraged as this is often ineffective and can be evaded. further measures should be taken as part of a defence-in-depth strategy. passwords should be stored as salted hashes and sensitive details (such as security questions/answers) should be stored encrypted. users should be prevented from setting very weak passwords and be advised to not use the same passwords they use elsewhere. in general, dynamic sql should not be used within the application. environments such as j2ee, asp.net, php, and perl support the use of parameterised queries or prepared statements to ensure that the structure of the sql statement is defined prior to entering user input. if it is necessary to use dynamic sql, user input should be validated and sanitised first. numeric input should be passed through a numeric check, and string input should be fixed to escape the single quote (') character. affects: ip address dns name 192.001.1.111 www.clientwebsite.com 1 owasp guidance https://www.owasp.org/index.php/sql_injection https://www.owasp.org/index.php/sql_injection_prevention_cheat_sheet https://www.owasp.org/index.php/query_parameterization_cheat_sheet 2 owasp top 10-injection https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/a1_2017-injection 3 cwe-089: improper neutralization of special elements used in an sql command ('sql injection') https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html",
